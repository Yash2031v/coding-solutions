## Problem

### Grid Jump

You are standing at point $(0, 0)$ of the 2D coordinate grid. You would like to reach point $(A, B)$.

You have the following movements available to you:

- Move either $1$ or $2$ steps right for a cost of $P$ coins. That is, you can move from $(x, y)$ to either $(x+1, y)$ or $(x+2, y)$ for a cost of $P$.
- Move either $1$ or $2$ steps up for a cost of $Q$ coins. That is, you can move from $(x, y)$ to either $(x, y+1)$ or $(x, y+2)$ for a cost of $Q$.
- Move $1$ step up and $1$ step right for a cost of $R$ coins. That is, you can move from $(x, y)$ to $(x+1, y+1)$ for a cost of $R$.

Find the minimum number of coins you need to spend in order to reach point $(A, B)$.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing five space-separated integers $A, B, P, Q, R$ — the coordinates of the destination point, and the movement costs.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the minimum number of coins you need to move to $(A, B)$.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \le A, B, P, Q, R \le 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
2 1 6 3 4
2 2 6 3 4
3 4 1 3 2
4 7 4 2 7

```

```
9
8
8
16

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  We want to reach $(2, 1)$. It's optimal to:

- Use the first type and move two steps right, with a cost of $P=6$.
- Use the second type and move one step up, with a cost of $Q=3$.

This will put us at $(2, 1)$ for a cost of $6+3 = 9$, which is the best we can do.

 **Test case $2$:**  We want to reach $(2, 2)$. It's optimal to use the third type of move (simultaneously move right and up one step each) two times, each costing $R=4$.
This will put us at $(2, 2)$ for a cost of $4+4=8$.
For the given costs, this is optimal.

```c_cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

void solve() {
    long long A, B, P, Q, R;
    cin >> A >> B >> P >> Q >> R;
    
    long long min_cost = -1;
    
    long long limit = min(A, B);
    for (long long k = 0; k <= limit; k++) {
        long long cost_diag = k * R;
        long long cost_right = ((A - k + 1) / 2) * P;
        long long cost_up = ((B - k + 1) / 2) * Q;
        
        long long total_cost = cost_diag + cost_right + cost_up;
        
        if (min_cost == -1 || total_cost < min_cost) {
            min_cost = total_cost;
        }
    }
    
    cout << min_cost << "\n";
}

int main() {
    // Fast I/O
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    
    int T;
    if (cin >> T) {
        while (T--) {
            solve();
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
